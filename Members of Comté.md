# Comté
Comté is the group who organise and help run events for I-UPS. This is a list of Comté members which is being provided alongside the general election material which can be found [here](./Elections).

## Members of Comté
The members of Comté are as follows:
- Chair
- Secretary
- University Liaison
- Social Media Manager
- Web Manager
- Discord Manager
- Events Manager
- Socials Manager
- Access and Inclusivity Officer

As a member of Comté, they are expected to attend meetings and to work in their role to help I-UPS function. Generally this does not exclusively make it so people work only within these specific boundaries and members typically help with events more generally if able. 

Only the core members of Comté, as listed above, are considered voting members. Anyone that is co-opted onto the committee or is invited to a meeting may be involved in discussion but not the final vote. 
### Co-opted members
People who are regularly interacting with the members of Comté and have a need to attend meetings can become co-opted members. As part of this, members gain access to the drive and other benefits of being on Comté however they do not gain voting rights. 

The number of co-opted members should be kept to a minimum and are to be organised with the Chair.

## Roles being retired
The following roles will no longer exist after this election cycle:
- Treasurer
- General Comté x3

### Treasurer
This role was created when I-UPS first started. The Triad as they were known had many ideas some of which would have involved money. We no longer have this aim, and the role has never acted as such and currently sits empty after the previous election attempt.
### General Comté
Originally this role was created to aid with general server management. As time has gone on, our events have been more run by a separate group.
