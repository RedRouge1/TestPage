## Members of Comté
The members of Comté are as follows:
- Chair
- Secretary
- University Liaison
- Social Media Secretary
- Technical Officer
- Discord Manager
- Events Manager
- A&I
- Discipline

As a member of Comté, they are expected to attend meetings and to work in their role to help I-UPS function. Generally this does not exclusively make it so people work only within these specific boundaries and members typically help with events more generally too if able. 

Only the core members of Comté, as listed above, are considered voting members. Anyone that is co-opted onto the committee or is invited to a meeting may be involved in discussion but not the final vote. 

### Co-opted members
People who are regularly interacting with the members of Comté and have a need to attend meetings can become co-opted members. As part of this, members gain access to the drive and other benefits of being on Comté however they do not gain voting rights. 

The number of co-opted members should be kept to a minimum.

#### Treasurer
This role was created when I-UPS first started. The Triad as they were known had many ideas some of which would have involved money. We no longer have this aim, and the role has never acted as such and currently sits empty after the previous election attempt.-
