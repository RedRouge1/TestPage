# I-UPS Election Period
I-UPS will be holding it's first ever election cycle. As to stagger the elections, a third of all roles will be up for election. Over the last few years, the goals of I-UPS have shifted and changed as our membership has and the roles we require have as well. Due to this, we will be rearranging the roles that exist and removing some roles. 
## How will the elections be run
I-UPS elections will take place in two main parts, nominations and elections, both of which will last a week. 

As part of the new rules, positions are open for a term of at **most 3 years** before they must be re-opened to nominations. 
### Which roles will be open this cycle
In this election cycle the following roles will be open for nominations:
- Events Manager
- Social Media Manager
- University Liaison

More information about these roles can be found [here](./Members%20of%20Comté).
### Returning Officer
Elections are to be ran by the Returning Officer, who will be responsible for organisation and running of the election. This is typically the Chair/Secretary of Comté. They **must be impartial** in the election. As a result they cannot be running for any position on Comté nor can they vote in the election, either by part of Comté or their own university. Multiple officers may be chosen if necessary, however they will each be under the same restrictions. 

The election must be run using the main I-UPS google account, with information stored outside of the Comté shared folder. Anyone with access to the I-UPS google account must cast their vote as part of Comté in the first 48 hours, otherwise they are not permitted to vote. Equally anyone able to see the contents of the vote are not permitted to discuss it with any party under any circumstances. If anyone is standing for election then they will be required to have their access to the account removed.
## Nominations
The nomination period will last a week. The Returning Officer will post the nomination form to the I-UPS discord server, which will be open for one full week. 

Nominations will be expected to provide a means of contact, a preferred name, the university that they are from, and a manifesto. Manifestos should be no longer than 200 words. 
### Who is eligible for nomination
Members of I-UPS are eligible to stand if they are currently or have previously attended a UK institution that is affiliated with I-UPS. 

Anyone that is currently banned by their affiliated Pokémon Society, equivalent group or by I-UPS itself are not eligible for nomination regardless of any other factors. 
## Break Period
Between the closing of nominations and the opening of elections there will be an ~2 day break. This is to give the Returning Officer time to add any late applicants to election information.
## Elections
Following the break period, the Returning Officer will open up elections. Elections will also run for a full week. 

The votes will be counted using Single Transferable Vote aka STV. Where the electorate ranks the available candidates in their order of preference. Specifically the method of STV used can be found detailed [here](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/single-transferable-vote/)

Any positions with nominations will have all candidates listed as well as Re-Open Nominations aka RON. Should RON win the election, then the post will remain unfilled and another election will be held at a later date. 

Equally if any positions do not receive any nominations then they will remain unfilled till another election can be held. This is before the following years election period. 

If after this the post is unfilled it will remain so until the following year. 
### Who is eligible to vote
Anyone that is considered member of an affiliated Pokémon Society or equivalent group may be involved in the voting. This also means alumni are able to vote via their institutions. 
### How will voting be counted
Comté does not have the means to individually verify the validity of individual votes. As such, each committee will vote on behalf of their university. It is up to each committee to determine how they wish to determine their vote. 

Each university will get a single vote as well as Comté which gets a single collective vote. (Note: anyone standing for election is not permitted to be involved in determining Comté's vote)

The votes will be counted by the Returning Officer, and will remain stored for two weeks after the election unless any objections are raised where this will be extended until the matter is resolved. Anyone who stood in the election as such cannot be given access to the main account until after the votes are discarded. 

In the very unlikely event the vote is tied, then the Returning Officer will break the tie.
### Election Canvasing
Any member standing for election may only post election material in designated locations. You must not post about it in the general I-UPS server, any I-UPS side servers or in any university society server without permission. Severe or repeated violations of these rules will be grounds for removal from the election, judged at the discretion of the Returning Officer
